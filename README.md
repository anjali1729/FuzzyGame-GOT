# fuzzy-nsm
(previously known as fuzzy-got)
Fuzzy simulation of war between NSM agents (Ninja, Samurai and Mage)

The objective of the project is to empower game development with an illusion of intelligence. Fuzzy logic is one among many techniques which should be one’s choice because of its simplicity in its implementation along with its expressive power. In this report we discuss the design and implementation of a fuzzy-based AI system for a multi-army war game. This would resemble a real-time game. In this game the characters Ninja, Samurai and Mage would attack and battle out against each other based on the fuzzy system’s intelligence. We discuss the different components of the game, variables, fuzzy rules, short comings and the future enhancements
